## Running Gen-Server Locally

After installing Cozy Creator, you want to run the gen-server and get it running. To do this, you need to start the gen-server with the command below:

``
cozy run
``

On startup, the Cozy Gen Server loads its configuration variables from several possible sources; this is the order of precedence:

1. Command-line arguments (ex; `cozy run --environment=development`)
2. Environment variables (ex; `export ENVIRONMENT=development`)
3. .env file (ex; `cozy run --env-file "./.env"`)
4. Secrets directory (ex; `cozy run --secrets-dir="/run/secrets"`)
5. Yaml config file (ex; `cozy run --config-file ./config.yaml`)
6. Default settings

export default ({ children }) => <div className="prose dark">{children}</div>;
