### Configuration

Cozy Creator supports multiple configuration formats:

1. Environment variables: These can be set directly or using a `.env` file.
2. YAML config file: For setting configuration variables.
3. Secrets directory: Used to load secrets from a specified location.

The most commonly used format is the `.env` file for setting environment variables. However, you can also use a YAML config file for more structured configuration settings.

By default, both of these files are loaded from the `~/.cozy-creator` directory. But you can specify a different location using the, `--env-file`, `--config-file` flag or the `--secrets-dir` flag.

#### Environment Variables

The `.env` file is used to set environment variables. As previously mentioned, they are loaded from the `~/.cozy-creator` directory unless you specify a different location using the `--env-file` flag.

Environment variables must have the `COZY_` prefix added in order to prevent collisions with other environment variables. For example `export COZY_PORT=9000` will work.

See our .env.example file for all available environment variables. Example:

``` cozy run --env-file="~/.cozy-creator/.env" ```

#### Yaml Config File

The yaml config file is used to set configuration variables. It is loaded from the `~/.cozy-creator` directory unless you specify a different location using the `--config-file` flag.

Example:

``` cozy run --config-file="~/.cozy-creator/config.yaml" ```

#### Secrets Directory

The secrets directory is used to load secrets from a directory. It is useful for storing sensitive information.

For the secrets-dir, use:

```sh cozy run --secrets-dir="/run/secrets" ```

export default ({ children }) => <div className="prose dark">{children}</div>;
